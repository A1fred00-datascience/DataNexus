## Project Overview

**DataNexus** is a recommendation system built for data science learners, featuring:

- **Adaptive Learning Paths**: Dynamically updated course and topic recommendations based on individual performance and goals.  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimizes recommendations for long-term user engagement and skill development.  
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Offers analytics and feedback on user progress.  
- **Scalable & Extensible**: Designed with modular architecture, making it extensible to other learning domains.

## Key Features

1. **Adaptive Learning Paths**  
   - Uses user interaction data (e.g., course completions, ratings, time spent) to recommend personalized learning resources.

2. **Reinforcement Learning**  
   - Focuses on long-term engagement and mastery rather than short-term clicks or views.

3. **Data-Driven Insights**  
   - Aggregates user data for analytics dashboards, providing feedback on skill progression.

4. **Scalable & Extensible**  
   - Modular pipeline and microservices-friendly design to accommodate additional topics and domains in the future.

- **Front-End (UI) or API**: Renders recommendations and captures user feedback.  
- **Backend Services**: Manages user sessions, authentication, and API requests.  
- **Recommendation System**: Implements collaborative filtering, reinforcement learning, and other algorithms.  
- **Data Store**: Houses user data, content metadata, and logs for historical insights.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Tracks user interactions (course completions, ratings, time spent, etc.).  
   - Optionally ingests external datasets (e.g., public course ratings).

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Normalizes and encodes data to create a user-course interaction matrix.  
   - Handles outliers, missing values, and feature engineering.

3. **Modeling**  
   - **Collaborative Filtering**: Provides a baseline model (e.g., user-based, item-based, matrix factorization).  
   - **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimizes recommendations over time for sustained engagement.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Uses precision, recall, and user satisfaction metrics to assess model performance.  
   - Performs A/B testing for online validation.

5. **Deployment**  
   - Recommendation results served through a front-end interface or via API calls.  
   - Containerized deployment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for scalability.
