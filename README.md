# DataNexus

## Project Overview
**DataNexus** is a personalized learning path recommendation system designed specifically for data science enthusiasts and learners. This system leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to curate tailored learning paths based on user behavior, preferences, and progress. The ultimate goal is to optimize the learning experience and help users efficiently achieve their data science goals.

---

## Key Features
- **Adaptive Learning Paths**: Dynamically recommends courses, topics, and resources based on user input and interaction history.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implements reinforcement learning to optimize recommendations for long-term learning engagement.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provides analytics and feedback on user progress and skill development.
- **Scalable Design**: Can be extended to other domains beyond data science.

## Project Architecture
### Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather user interaction data (e.g., course completions, ratings, and time spent on topics).
2. **Preprocessing**: Normalize and encode data to create user-course interaction matrices.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Collaborative Filtering for baseline recommendations.
   - Reinforcement Learning (e.g., Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks) for dynamic recommendations.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using precision, recall, and user satisfaction metrics.
5. **Deployment**: Provide recommendations via a simple front-end interface or API.

## Usage
1. Upload user data or use the sample dataset provided.
2. Input learning preferences (e.g., topics, difficulty levels).
3. View and interact with recommended learning paths.
4. Monitor progress through the analytics dashboard.

---

## Dataset
- Example datasets are available in the `data/` directory.
- **Sample Format**:
  - `user_id, course_id, interaction_type, timestamp`
  - `course_id, course_name, difficulty, duration, prerequisites`
